  ## Description
  Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

  ## Installation
  The installation process begins with npm install followed by installing the required dependencies of mysql, express, and express-handlebars
